            <h2>Our Story: The Day Fate Intervened ✨</h2>
            <p>
                The start of our story is one I can replay in my mind as clearly as if it happened five minutes ago. It all began in the middle of a stressful exam, with you sitting just inches away from me. I was supposed to be focusing on the test booklet, but honestly, my concentration vanished the second you entered my field of vision. Every time I looked up, there you were—looking so calm, so focused, and so incredibly cute. That moment created an overwhelming, distracting feeling of instant attraction that completely derailed my thoughts. I kept trying to convince myself to concentrate, but my heart was already gone, racing with a nervousness that had absolutely nothing to do with the exam questions. That feeling was the start of everything.

            <p>
                I spent the next hour caught between trying to focus on my paper and stealing glances at you. It felt like a scene from a movie, and I thought, "This is crazy; nothing can come of this." I made a firm decision to push the feelings down, finish the exam, and chalk it up as a beautiful, fleeting distraction. When the invigilator announced the switch to the next section, I was ready to leave that emotional chaos behind and simply move on with my day. I had convinced myself that this wonderful feeling would just remain a secret, a quiet memory of a beautiful stranger who happened to sit next to me during a test. I couldn't have been more wrong.

                Just as the papers were shuffled and we had a brief moment of quiet, you completely stunned me. You turned, looked right into my eyes—those beautiful, special eyes—and confessed that you had noticed me too! You admitted that I had distracted **you** just as much as you had distracted me. The shock, the relief, and the sudden joy were indescribable. It was the best plot twist of my life, a moment where fate slammed the door shut on my previous plans and opened a brand-new, amazing chapter. That day wasn't just about passing an exam; it was the definitive start of **our whole book**. Thank you, Shreeja, for choosing me and for making my greatest distraction my greatest love.
