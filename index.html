            <h2>Our Story: Exam Hall Magic ✨</h2>
            <p>
                The very first time I saw you was during the exam, sitting right next to me. Even under the pressure of the test, I couldn't help but notice how incredibly cute you were. My heart instantly told me you were special. I thought that moment might pass, but then you surprised me! In the next section, you let me know the feeling was mutual. It was the best plot twist of my life. That day wasn't just about an exam; it was the start of **our whole book**. Thank you for choosing me.
